/**
 * The MovieClip class associates a TweenJS Timeline with an EaselJS {{#crossLink "Container"}}{{/crossLink}}. It allows
 * you to create objects which encapsulate timeline animations, state changes, and synched actions. The MovieClip
 * class has been included in the EaselJS minified file since 0.7.0.
 *
 * Currently MovieClip only works properly if it is tick based (as opposed to time based) though some concessions have
 * been made to support time-based timelines in the future.
 *
 * <h4>Example</h4>
 * This example animates two shapes back and forth. The grey shape starts on the left, but we jump to a mid-point in
 * the animation using {{#crossLink "MovieClip/gotoAndPlay"}}{{/crossLink}}.
 *
 *      var stage = new createjs.Stage("canvas");
 *      createjs.Ticker.addEventListener("tick", stage);
 *
 *      var mc = new createjs.MovieClip({loop:-1, labels:{myLabel:20}});
 *      stage.addChild(mc);
 *
 *      var child1 = new createjs.Shape(
 *          new createjs.Graphics().beginFill("#999999")
 *              .drawCircle(30,30,30));
 *      var child2 = new createjs.Shape(
 *          new createjs.Graphics().beginFill("#5a9cfb")
 *              .drawCircle(30,30,30));
 *
 *      mc.timeline.addTween(
 *          createjs.Tween.get(child1)
 *              .to({x:0}).to({x:60}, 50).to({x:0}, 50));

 *              .to({x:60}).to({x:0}, 50).to({x:60}, 50));
 *
 *      mc.gotoAndPlay("start");
 *
 * It is recommended to use <code>tween.to()</code> to animate and set properties (use no duration to have it set
 * immediately), and the <code>tween.wait()</code> method to create delays between animations. Note that using the
 * <code>tween.set()</code> method to affect properties will likely not provide the desired result.
